# High Risk Municipalities for Bike Thefts
## Neighborhood Segmentation and Clustering with Foursquare API

### Overview
- Utilized HTML, Python, and Python’s Pandas, Folium, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib libraries to find the best geological location to satisfy a set of constraints.
- Retrieved geospatial data from the Foursquare Places API and obtained population/crime related datasets from the city of Toronto’s Open Data Portal.
- Processed, merged, segmented, and analyzed datasets containing over 25,000 entries.
- Surveyed a geological area of 700 km2and constructed a heatmap to visualize the data.
- Plotted results using methods of K-means clustering powered by machine learning classification.
